    In brief

grake is a command line tool for scanning webpages for Youtube links.

Make sure you read the manual page for grake (see Installation below).

Project:
    <http://grake.googlecode.com/>

Development repository:
    <git://repo.or.cz/grake.git>


    Installation

This is an optional step, you could just as well copy the bin/grake
file to your path and start using it. The installation takes care
of generating the grake(1) manual from bin/grake but you can also
use "perldoc bin/grake" if you want to skip the installation
altogether.

Prerequisites:

  * See Makefile.PL for these

If you choose to install:

  * Make sure you REMOVE any earlier version of grake before you continue

  * INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where grake will
  be installed, e.g.:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local

  * Typical steps:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
